Boost Python Iterators
----------------------

https://wiki.python.org/moin/boost.python/iterator defines how iterators are supposed to be
exported in Boost.Python but there appears to be a bug in some cases as detailed in https://github.com/boostorg/python/issues/61. This is a basic (not-generic)
workaround.
